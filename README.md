College Management System
The project is a content management system for schools, colleges, and universities. By using the system, all the students, teachers, and employees can see their related information by logging in. 
We have kept restricted in login as only registered users, i.e., employees, teachers, or enrolled students, can access the database information. Moreover, it shows relevant and personal records as of the Institution's policy. In contrast, admins have access to looking over all the database records after a successful login.
